# Description of Custom Internal Functions

## Colosseum

Function that returns a simple asci art of Colosseum

*Function name*: `colosseum`

*Input Paramenters*: none

## ComputePI

This *single-thread* internal function (included in the service-cell code) stresses the CPU by computing `D` decimal points of pi, where `D` is a random integer in `range_complexity` (e.g. 50,100). The return is a string whose length is a sample of an exp neg random variable with mean `mean_bandwidth` kBytes  

*Function name*: `compute_pi`

*Default Input Paramenters*:

```json
{
    "range_complexity": [50, 100], 
    "mean_bandwidth": 10
}
```

## Loader

This *multi-thread* internal function sequentially load the CPU, the memory, the disk and then sleep for a bit. Finally, it returns a string whose length is a sample of an exp neg random variable with mean `mean_bandwidth` kBytes.

The CPU stress is performed (if `run`=true) by running `thread_pool_size` parallel jobs. Each job computes `D` decimal points of pi, where `D` is a random integer in `range_complexity` (e.g. 50,100). The computation is repeated sequentially `trials` times per job.

The memory stress is performed (if `run`=true) by allocating `memory_size` kBytes. Then `memory_io` read/write operations of 1 byte are executed sequentially.

The disk stress is performed by creating the file `tmp_file_name`. Writing `disk_write_block_count` blocks of  `disk_write_block_size` bytes. Finally, random accessing each of them once.

The sleep stress is performed (if `run`=true) by sleeping for `sleep_time` seconds.

*Function name*: `loader`

*Default Input Paramenters*:

        "cpu_stress": {
            "run":false,
