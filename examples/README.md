# Examples

This folder contains some `workmodel.json` files created using the [WorkModelGenerator](../WorkModelGenerator/) and used to generate applications to benchmark.

In particular, to study the impact of splitting the application workload into services, we generated applications with an increasing number of microservices (N), from 1 (monolithic) to 10, and are configured as follows:
* the service-mesh has the star topology in Fig. 1b and the links’ probabilities are all equal to 1, therefore all the microservices are involved for each user request;
* users send requests to the microservice `s0`, which in turn calls all the other N − 1 downstream microservices, either in **sequence** or in **parallel**;
* the inter-service communications use the HTTP/REST model;
* the internal-service run by the N microservices is the same. It is the `loader` function, presented [here](/Docs/Manual.md#Work-Model-Generator). It is configured to transmit back 100 kB, stress only the CPU by computing 100 digits of Pi (π) and repeating this computation 100/N times. The overall amount of π digits computed by the application is 100,000 independent of N. Thus we can make a computation-fair comparison versus N microservices.

The file `workmodel-serial-xservice,json` is the workload file for the application made of `x` microservices performing HTTP sequential calls. The file `workmodel-parallel-xservice.json` is the workload file for for the application made of `x` microservices performing HTTP parallel calls.

We also generated other 4 applications with 20 microservices with the same workload but with different microservice mesh topologies, namely the ones in Fig. 1: A, B, C, D. The HTTP calls are performed in sequence. 

Additionally, the topology C has a `workmodelC-multi.json` with introduced randomness in spanning the mesh for serving a request and heterogeneity in internal-services. Specifically:
* we used a probability equal to 0.5 for each link of the mesh, with the exclusion of links `s0`-`s3`) and `s3`-`s8`, for which we used a probability equal to 1. Therefore, `s0`, `s3` and `s8` are involved in any user request.
* the microservice `s8` is the only one that stresses the CPU. 
* the microservice `s0` does not perform any internal-service
* the other microservices either load the memory or the disk with read/write operations.


# Alibaba derived applications and traces
The `Alibaba` folder contains the Matlab code we used to create 30 applications from [Alibaba microservice traces](https://github.com/alibaba/clusterdata/tree/master/cluster-trace-microservices-v2021).

The traces-mbench.zip file contains parallel (`par` folder) and sequential (`seq` folder) traces of these applications. Each application has its folder that contain the traces and a `servicemesh.json`. file that can be used to generate the `workmodel.json` file through the `WorkModelGenerator`.

To perform a trace-based request it is possible to use 
```zsh
curl -X POST -i <access-gateway-ip>:31113/s0  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d @TRACE_FILE
```

# Teastore emulation
The `Teastore` folder contains a workmodel file we used to create a µBench application to mimic the [Teastore] (https://github.com/DescartesResearch/TeaStore) application in terms of service mesh, CPU used by microservices and request latency.
